Adds a simple expanding sign-in form like the old-style Twitter.

== Description ==

WordPress plugin to create a simple expanding sign-in form like the old-style Twitter. This was customized for a project with the Oklahoma Bar Association that never made it out of development.

Original idea from http://aext.net/2009/08/perfect-sign-in-dropdown-box-likes-twitter-with-jquery/.

My additions:

- Show the password in either plaintext or as dots.
- Open the password reminder in a modal window from the OBAâ€™s members website.

== Installation ==

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up for **strong**.

\`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>\`
